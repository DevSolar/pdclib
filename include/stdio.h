   regardless to fseek() calls). Note that binary files opened in append mode
   might have their end-of-file padded with '\0' characters.

   Update modes mean that both input and output functions can be performed on
   the stream, but output must be terminated with a call to either fflush(),
   fseek(), fsetpos(), or rewind() before input is performed, and input must
   be terminated with a call to either fseek(), fsetpos(), or rewind() before
   output is performed, unless input encountered end-of-file.

   to open a binary stream instead. This implementation honors the exact mode
   given.

   Write output to the given stream, as defined by the given format string and

   The format string is written to the given stream verbatim, except for any

   documented below. If the given conversion specifiers require more arguments
   from the argument stack than provided, behaviour is undefined. Additional
   arguments not required by conversion specifiers are evaluated but otherwise
   ignored.

   (The standard specifies the format string is allowed to contain multibyte
   character sequences as long as it starts and ends in initial shift state,
   but this is not yet supported by this implementation, which interprets the
   format string as sequence of char.)
   TODO: Add multibyte support to printf() functions.

   A conversion specifier consists of:
   - Zero or more flags (one of the characters "-+ #0").
   - Optional minimum field width as decimal integer. Default is padding to the
     left, using spaces. Note that 0 is taken as a flag, not the beginning of a
     field width. Note also that a small field width will not result in the
     truncation of a value.
   - Optional precision (given as ".#" with # being a decimal integer),
     specifying:
     - the min. number of digits to appear (diouxX),
     - the max. number of digits after the decimal point (aAeEfF),
     - the max. number of significant digits (gG),
     - the max. number of bytes to be written (s).
     - behaviour with other conversion specifiers is undefined.
   - Optional length modifier specifying the size of the argument (one of "hh",
     "ll", or one of the characters "hljztL").
   - Conversion specifier character specifying the type of conversion to be
     applied (and the type of the next argument from the argument stack). One
     of the characters "diouxXfFeEgGaAcspn%".

   Minimum field width and/or precision may be given as asterisk ('*') instead
   of a decimal integer. In this case, the next argument from the argument
   stack is assumed to be an int value specifying the width / precision. A
   negative field width is interpreted as flag '-' followed by a positive field
   width. A negative precision is interpreted as if no precision was given.

   FLAGS
   -     Left-justify the conversion result within its field width.
   +     Prefix a '+' on positive signed conversion results. Prefix a '-' on
         floating conversions resulting in negative zero, or negative values
         rounding to zero.
   space Prefix a space on positive signed conversion results, or if a signed
         conversion results in no characters. If both '+' and ' ' are given,
         ' ' is ignored.
   #     Use an "alternative form" for
         - 'o' conversion, increasing precision until the first digit of the
           result is a zero;
         - 'x' or 'X' conversion, prefixing "0x" or "0X" to nonzero results;
         - "aAeEfF" conversions, always printing a decimal point even if no
           digits are following;
         - 'g' or 'G' conversions, always printing a decimal point even if no
           digits are following, and not removing trailing zeroes.
         - behaviour for other conversions is unspecified.
   0     Use leading zeroes instead of spaces for field width padding. If both
         '-' and '0' are given, '0' is ignored. If a precision is specified for
         any of the "diouxX" conversions, '0' is ignored. Behaviour is only
         defined for "diouxXaAeEfFgG".

   LENGTH MODIFIERS
   hh  For "diouxX" conversions, the argument from the argument stack is
       assumed to be of char width. (It will have been subject to integer
       promotion but will be converted back.) For 'n' conversions, the argument
       is assumed to be a pointer to signed char.
   h   For "diouxX" conversions, the argument from the argument stack is
       assumed to be of short int width. (It will have been subject to integer
       promotion but will be converted back.) For 'n' conversions, the argument
       is assumed to be a pointer to short int.
   l   For "diouxX" conversions, the argument from the argument stack is
       assumed to be of long int width. For 'n' conversions, the argument is
       assumed to be a pointer to short int. For 'c' conversions, the argument
       is assumed to be a wint_t. For 's' conversions, the argument is assumed
       to be a pointer to wchar_t. No effect on "aAeEfFgG" conversions.
   ll  For "diouxX" conversions, the argument from the argument stack is
       assumed to be of long long int width. For 'n' conversions, the argument
       is assumed to be a pointer to long long int.
   j   For "diouxX" conversions, the argument from the argument stack is
       assumed to be of intmax_t width. For 'n' conversions, the argument is
       assumed to be a pointer to intmax_t.
   z   For "diouxX" conversions, the argument from the argument stack is
       assumed to be of size_t width. For 'n' conversions, the argument is
       assumed to be a pointer to size_t.
   t   For "diouxX" conversions, the argument from the argument stack is
       assumed to be of ptrdiff_t width. For 'n' conversions, the argument is
       assumed to be a pointer to ptrdiff_t.
   L   For "aAeEfFgG" conversions, the argument from the argument stack is
       assumed to be a long double.
   Length modifiers appearing for any conversions not mentioned above will have
   undefined behaviour.
   If a length modifier appears with any conversion specifier other than as
   specified above, the behavior is undefined.

   CONVERSION SPECIFIERS
   d,i The argument from the argument stack is assumed to be of type int, and
       is converted to a signed decimal value with a minimum number of digits
       as specified by the precision (default 1), padded with leading zeroes.
       A zero value converted with precision zero yields no output.
   o   The argument from the argument stack is assumed to be of type unsigned
       int, and is converted to an unsigned octal value, other behaviour being
       as above.
   u   The argument from the argument stack is assumed to be of type unsigned
       int, and converted to an unsigned decimal value, other behaviour being
       as above.
   x,X The argument from the argument stack is assumed to be of type unsigned
       int, and converted to an unsigned hexadecimal value, using lowercase
       "abcdef" for 'x' and uppercase "ABCDEF" for 'X' conversion, other
       behaviour being as above.
   f,F The argument from the argument stack is assumed to be of type double,
       and converted to a decimal floating point in decimal-point notation,
       with the number of digits after the decimal point as specified by the
       precision (default 6) and the value being rounded appropriately. If
       precision is zero (and the '#' flag is not given), no decimal point is
       printed. At least one digit is always printed before the decimal point.
       For 'f' conversions, an infinity value is printed as either [-]inf or
       [-]infinity (, depending on the configuration of this implementation. A
       NaN value is printed as [-]nan. For 'F' conversions uppercase characters
       are used for these special values. The flags '-', '+' and ' ' apply as
       usual to these special values, '#' and '0' have no effect.
   e,E The argument from the argument stack is assumed to be of type double,
       and converted to a decimal floating point in normalized exponential
       notation ([?]d.ddd edd). "Normalized" means one nonzero digit before
       the decimal point, unless the value is zero. The number of digits after
       the decimal point is specified by the precision (default 6), the value
       being rounded appropriately. If precision is zero (and the '#' flag is
       not given), no decimal point is printed. The exponent has at least two
       digits, and not more than necessary to represent the exponent. If the
       value is zero, the exponent is zero. The 'e' written to indicate the
       exponend is uppercase for 'E' conversions.
       Infinity or NaN values are represented as for 'f' and 'F' conversions,
       respectively.
   g,G The argument from the argument stack is assumed to be of type double,
       and converted according to either 'f' or 'e' format for 'g' conversions,
       or 'F' or 'E' format for 'G' conversions, respectively, with the actual
       conversion chosen depending on the value. 'e' / 'E' conversion is chosen
       if the resulting exponent is < -4 or >= the precision (default 1).
       Trailing zeroes are removed (unless the '#' flag is given). A decimal
       point appears only if followed by a digit.
       Infinity or NaN values are represented as for 'f' and 'F' conversions,
       respectively.
   a,A The argument from the argument stack is assumed to be of type double,
       and converted to a floating point hexadecimal notation ([?]0xh.hhhh pd)
       with one hexadecimal digit (being nonzero if the value is normalized,
       and otherwise unspecified) before the decimal point, and the number of
       digits after the decimal point being specified by the precision. If no
       precision is given, the default is to print as many digits as nevessary
       to give an exact representation of the value (if FLT_RADIX is a power of
       2). If no precision is given and FLT_RADIX is not a power of 2, the
       default is to print as many digits to distinguish values of type double
       (possibly omitting trailing zeroes). (A precision p is sufficient to
       distinguish values of the source type if 16^p-1 > b^n where b is
       FLT_RADIX and n is the number of digits in the significand (to base b)
       of the source type. A smaller p might suffice depending on the
       implementation's scheme for determining the digit to the left of the
       decimal point.) The error has the correct sign for the current rounding
       direction.
       Unless the '#' flag is given, no decimal-point is given for zero
       precision.
       The 'a' conversion uses lowercase "abcdef", "0x" and 'p', the 'A'
       conversion uppercase "ABCDEF", "0X" and 'P'.
       The exponent always has at least one digit, and not more than necessary
       to represent the decimal exponent of 2. If the value is zero, the
       exponent is zero.
       Infinity or NaN values are represented as for 'f' and 'F' conversions,
       respectively.
       Binary implementations are at liberty to chose the hexadecimal digit to
       the left of the decimal point so that subsequent digits align to nibble
       boundaries.
   c   The argument from the argument stack is assumed to be of type int, and
       converted to a character after the value has been cast to unsigned char.
       If the 'l' length modifier is given, the argument is assumed to be of
       type wint_t, and converted as by a "%ls" conversion with no precision
       and a pointer to a two-element wchar_t array, with the first element
       being the wint_t argument and the second a '\0' wide character.
   s   The argument from the argument stack is assumed to be a char array (i.e.
       pointer to char). Characters from that array are printed until a zero
       byte is encountered or as many bytes as specified by a given precision
       have been written.
       If the l length modifier is given, the argument from the argument stack
       is assumed to be a wchar_t array (i.e. pointer to wchar_t). Wide
       characters from that array are converted to multibyte characters as by
       calls to wcrtomb() (using a mbstate_t object initialized to zero prior
       to the first conversion), up to and including the terminating null wide
       character. The resulting multibyte character sequence is then printed up
       to but not including the terminating null character. If a precision is
       given, it specifies the maximum number of bytes to be written (including
       shift sequences). If the given precision would require access to a wide
       character one past the end of the array, the array shall contain a '\0'
       wide character. In no case is a partial multibyte character written.
       Redundant shift sequences may result if the multibyte characters have a
       state-dependent encoding.
       TODO: Clarify these statements regarding %ls.
   p   The argument from the argument stack is assumed to be a void pointer,
       and converted to a sequence of printing characters in an implementation-
       defined manner.
       This implementation casts the pointer to type intptr_t, and prints the
       value as if a %#x conversion specifier was given.
   n   The argument from the argument stack is assumed to be a pointer to a
       signed integer, into which the number of characters written so far by
       this call to fprintf is stored. The behaviour, should any flags, field
       widths, or precisions be given is undefined.
   %   A verbatim '%' character is written. No argument is taken from the
       argument stack.

   otherwise.

/*
   Read input from a given stream, as defined by the given format string, and

   The format string contains a sequence of directives that are expected to
   match the input. If such a directive fails to match, the function returns
   (matching error). It also returns if an input error occurs (input error).

   Directives can be:

   CONVERSION SPECIFIERS
   d    Matches an (optionally signed) decimal integer of the format expected
        by strtol() with base 10. The next pointer from the argument stack is
        assumed to point to a signed integer.
   i    Matches an (optionally signed) integer of the format expected by
        strtol() with base 0. The next pointer from the argument stack is
        assumed to point to a signed integer.
   o    Matches an (optionally signed) octal integer of the format expected by
        strtoul() with base 8. The next pointer from the argument stack is
        assumed to point to an unsigned integer.
   u    Matches an (optionally signed) decimal integer of the format expected
        by strtoul() with base 10. The next pointer from the argument stack is
        assumed to point to an unsigned integer.
   x    Matches an (optionally signed) hexadecimal integer of the format
        expected by strtoul() with base 16. The next pointer from the argument
        stack is assumed to point to an unsigned integer.
   aefg Matches an (optionally signed) floating point number, infinity, or not-
        a-number-value of the format expected by strtod(). The next pointer
        from the argument stack is assumed to point to a float.
   c    Matches a number of characters as specified by the field width (default
        1). The next pointer from the argument stack is assumed to point to a
        character array large enough to hold that many characters.
        If the 'l' length modifier is given, the input is assumed to match a

        which will be converted to a wide character sequence as by successive

        assumed to point to a wchar_t array large enough to hold that many
        characters.
        In either case, note that no '\0' character is added to terminate the
        sequence.
   s    Matches a sequence of non-white-space characters. The next pointer from
        the argument stack is assumed to point to a character array large
        enough to hold the sequence including terminating '\0' character.
        If the 'l' length modifier is given, the input is assumed to match a
        sequence of multibyte characters (starting in the initial shift state),
        which will be converted to a wide character sequence as by a call to
        mbrtowc() with a mbstate_t object initialized to zero prior to the
        first conversion. The next pointer from the argument stack is assumed
        to point to a wchar_t array large enough to hold the sequence including
        terminating '\0' character.
   [    Matches a nonempty sequence consisting of any of those characters
        specified between itself and a corresponding closing bracket (']').
        If the first character in the list is a circumflex ('^'), this matches
        a nonempty sequence consisting of any characters NOT specified. If the
        closing bracket appears as the first character in the scanset ("[]" or
        "[^]", it is assumed to belong to the scanset, which then ends with the
        NEXT closing bracket.
        If there is a '-' character in the scanset which is not the first after
        the opening bracket (or the circumflex, see above) or the last in the
        scanset, behaviour is implementation-defined. This implementation
        handles this character like any other.

        The extend of the input field is determined byte-by-byte for the above
        conversions ('c', 's', '['), with no special provisions being made for
        multibyte characters. The resulting field is nevertheless a multibyte
        sequence begining in intial shift state.

   p    Matches a sequence of characters as produced by the printf() "%p"
        conversion. The next pointer from the argument stack is assumed to
        point to a void pointer, which will be filled with the same location
        as the pointer used in the printf() statement. Note that behaviour is
        undefined if the input value is not the result of an earlier printf()
        call.
   n    Does not read input. The next pointer from the argument stack is
        assumed to point to a signed integer, into which the number of
        characters read from input so far by this call to fscanf() is stored.
        This does not affect the return value of fscanf(). The behaviour,
        should an assignment-supressing character of field width be given,
        is undefined.
        This can be used to test the success of literal matches and suppressed
        assignments.
   %    Matches a single, verbatim '%' character.

   A, E, F, G and X are valid, and equivalent to their lowercase counterparts.

   All conversions except [, c, or n imply that whitespace characters from the
   input stream are consumed until a non-whitespace character is encountered.
   Such whitespaces do not count against a maximum field width.

   Conversions push at most one character back into the input stream. That
   implies that some character sequences converted by the strtol() and strtod()
   function families are not converted identically by the scnaf() function
   family.

   Returns the number of input items successfully assigned. This can be zero if
   an early mismatch occurs. Returns EOF if an input failure occurs before the
   first conversion.
